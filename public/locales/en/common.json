  "experienceHeader": "Experience",
  "tmpText": "TalentMarketplace is a top placement platform matching employers and candidates. I developed new features, improved existing ones, and fixed bugs. I also mentored a junior developer. I worked on both frontend and backend until a backend developer joined the team. Although most of the features I worked on are not accessible to unregistered users, I had the opportunity to develop the employersâ€™ landing pages (links), coding prototypes made by a designer."
