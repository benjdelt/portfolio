    "experienceText": "Talent Marketplace is a top placement platform matching employers and candidates. For 2 years, I developed new features, improved existing ones, and fixed bugs. Starting September 2020, I also mentored a junior developer. I worked on both frontend and backend until a backend developer joined the team. Then I focused on the React frontend, collaborating with the backend developer. Although most of the features I worked on are not accessible to unregistered users, I had the opportunity to develop the employersâ€™ landing pages (links), applying prototypes made by a designer with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery)."
